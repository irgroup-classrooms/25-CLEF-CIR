# CLEF25 LongEval: CIR_cluster at LongEval 2025: Clustering Query Variants for Temporal Generalization

### Abstract
> Temporal dynamics in retrieval settings have shown to carry helpful information for retrieval processes. In this submission to the CLEF LongEval lab we propose five different approaches: (1) Finding time-dependent queries with the help of LLMs and to treat these queries differently by boosting their retrieval scores based on the categorization; (2) Finding time-dependent queries and scoring them on a scale from 0 to 1 and to use that score to influence the final ranking; (3) Using relevance information from older sub-collections and to use relevance feedback on the current sub-collection by using query expansion using tf-idf; (4) Boosting known relevant documents-query pairs from older sub-collections but comparing the similarity of old and recent documents; Finally, (5) a neural relevance re-ranking based on a topcial semantic clustering.
